# housing-nz
A list of websites, datasets and other information about housing and social housing in New Zealand.

The list has been pulled together as part of a Newsable project looking at ways to tell stories about complex social issues.

Newsable is participating in a teaching project at AUT's Co-Lab in the second semester of 2016. Students will focus on a housing-related theme and explore ways to share complex information with a target audience using whatever formats and tools they like.
